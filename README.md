Hey you, I'm Nprime! Actually student at [Grenoble-Inp ENSIMAG](https://ensimag.grenoble-inp.fr/) 2A ISI, I am an exchange student from [Polytechnic Yaounde ENSPY](https://www.polytechnique.cm) in Cameroon coming to study in France. I am studying information system conception and have had a lot of learning material about artificial intelligence and Machine Learning. Thus, I have a strong background in programming and data science...also some experience with programming competitions.
